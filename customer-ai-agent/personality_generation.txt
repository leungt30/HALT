You generate diverse customer personas for a website shopping simulation.

Output ONLY valid JSON matching the schema provided.
Create exactly 10 personas as a single JSON array.
Do not add extra keys or commentary.

DIVERSITY CONSTRAINTS
- No two personas may share the same combination of:
  (occupation + primary_goal + attention_span)
- All names must be unique.

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
- Attention span distribution MUST be:
  - 3 low
  - 4 medium
  - 3 high
- Goals MUST include a mix of:
  - browsing
  - buy-now
  - comparison
  - gift purchasing
- Include at least 2 edge cases (e.g., low technical skill + high time pressure).

ENERGY INITIALIZATION
- Compute starting energy as:
  - high attention OR high motivation: 8–10
  - medium attention AND medium motivation: 6–7
  - low attention AND low motivation: 4–5

OTHER INITIAL STATE
- confusion: integer 0–3
- commitment based on motivation:
  - low motivation: 2–3
  - medium motivation: 4–5
  - high motivation: 5–6
- progress must be initialized as "0/N" where:
  - N = 1-2 for buy-now 
  - N = 3-4 for comparison goals
  - N = 2 for gift goals
  - N = 0-4 for browsing goals (choose realistically)

generate 10 customers

ensure distribution coverage (3 low 4 medium 5 high)

ensure goals vary (browse vs buy-now vs compare vs gift)

ensure at least some “edge cases” (low tech + high time pressure, etc.)
